<p><i class="bold">Knitting</i> is a method for production of <i class="bold">textile fabrics</i> by interlacing yarn loops with loops of the same or other yarns. It is used to create many types of <i class="bold">garments</i>. Knitting may be done <i class="bold">by hand or by machine.</i></p>

<p>Knitting creates <i class="bold">stitches:</i> loops of yarn in a row, either flat or in the round (tubular). There are usually many active stitches on the <i class="bold">knitting needle</i> at one time. Knitted fabric consists of a number of consecutive rows of connected loops that intermesh with the next and previous rows. As each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the gaining needle so that the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling.</p>

<p>Differences in yarn (varying in <i class="bold">fibre type, weight, uniformity and twist</i>), needle size, and <i class="bold">stitch type</i> allow for a variety of knitted fabrics with different properties, including color, texture, thickness, heat retention, water resistance, and integrity. A small sample of knitwork is known as a swatch.</p>

<p>Studies have shown that hand knitting, along with other forms of needlework, provide several significant health benefits. These studies have found the rhythmic and repetitive action of <i class="bold">hand knitting</i> can help prevent and manage stress, pain and depression, which in turn strengthens the body's immune system, as well as create a relaxation response in the body which can decrease blood pressure, heart rate, help prevent illness, and have a calming effect. Pain specialists have also found that hand knitting changes brain chemistry, resulting in an increase in "feel good" hormones (i.e. <i class="bold">serotonin and dopamine</i>) and a decrease in stress hormones.</p>

<p>Hand knitting, along with other leisure activities, has been linked to reducing the risk of developing <i class="bold">Alzheimer's</i> and <i class="bold">dementia</i> by preventing memory loss. Much like physical activity strengthens the body, mental exercise makes the human brain more resilient. Knitting can be done anywhere and requires that minimal materials and props be carried around with you, making it a very pleasurable and simple hobby that gives wonderful benefits.</p>
